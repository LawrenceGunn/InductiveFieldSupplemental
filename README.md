# Inductive Field Supplemental Materials

The files contained in this repository are part of the supplemental material for the paper *An electric field property that corresponds to the Maxwell-Faraday equation*.

Two of the computations are for mutual inductance of wire circuits and are implemented in MATLAB and Mathematica. These under the ```mutual-inductance``` directory.

The third set of source code is the C++ for straight wire self-inductance and is in the directory ```self-inductance```.

In each directory there is a README.md providing instructions on how to compile and/or run the files.
