# Mutual inductance of wire circuits

For the paper *An electric field property that corresponds to the Maxwell-Faraday equation*, the mutual inductance between two wire circuits is determined numerically in two Mathematica notebooks, one for circular circuits, the other for rectangular.

Each notebook has a description of the circuits, a short discussion of the equations, and the Mathematica source code. The values calculated by these notebooks were used in the tables of mutual inductance results of the paper.

If Mathematica is not available to the user, the equivalently named PDF documents are printed static versions of the notebooks.
