# Mutual inductance of wire circuits

For the paper *An inductive field component of the electric field that corresponds to Faraday's law*, the mutual inductance between two wire circuits is determined numerically in two Mathematica notebooks, one for circular circuits, the other for rectangular.

Each notebook has a description of the circuits, a short discussion of the equations, and the Mathematica source code.

If Mathematica is not available the equivalently named PDF documents are printed static versions of the notebooks.
