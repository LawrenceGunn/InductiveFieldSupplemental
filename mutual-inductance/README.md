# Mutual inductance of wire circuits

For the paper *An inductive field component of the electric field that corresponds to Faraday's law*, the mutual inductance between two wire circuits is determined numerically in two Mathematica notebooks.

Each notebook has a short description of the derivation as well as notes about the Mathematica implementation.

If Mathematica is not available then the PDF version of the notebooks can be inspected.
